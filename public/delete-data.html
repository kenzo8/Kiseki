  <h1>Request data deletion – Kien</h1>
  <p class="intro">This page explains how to request that <strong>some or all of your data</strong> in the <strong>Kien</strong> app is deleted. Kien is the app name shown on the store listing. You can delete data without deleting your account.</p>

  <h2>Steps to request that your data is deleted</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the <strong>Kien</strong> app on your device and sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>To delete a device entry:</strong> Open the device (from your profile or explore), then use <strong>Delete</strong> or <strong>Remove</strong> to remove it from your profile. That device’s data is permanently deleted.</li>
    <li><strong>To remove a wishlist item:</strong> Open the device from your wants list and choose to remove it from your wants. That wishlist entry is permanently deleted.</li>
    <li>Repeat as needed to delete as many devices or wishlist items as you want. Your account stays active.</li>
    <li><strong>To delete all of your data and your account:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Account</strong> → <strong>Delete Account</strong> and confirm. See our <a href="delete-account.html">account deletion page</a> for details.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Types of data that are deleted or kept</h2>
  <p><strong>When you delete a device or remove a wishlist item (without deleting your account):</strong></p>
  <ul class="data-list">
    <li><strong>Deleted:</strong> That device entry (name, notes, and any linked data) or that wishlist entry. Deletion is permanent.</li>
    <li><strong>Kept:</strong> Your account, profile (display name, photo), and all other device and wishlist data you did not delete.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>When you delete your account:</strong> Your account, profile, and all device and wishlist data are permanently deleted. See <a href="delete-account.html">delete-account.html</a> for full details.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <div class="retention">
    <p><strong>No additional retention.</strong> When you delete a device, remove a wishlist item, or delete your account, we do not retain that data. Deletion is permanent with no retention period.</p>
  </div>

  <p style="margin-top: 32px; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">For help, contact the developer (see the app’s store listing or in-app feedback/support).</p>
